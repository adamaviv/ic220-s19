### Course Descrition

This course introduces students to performance metrics, instruction set
architectures, assembly language, logic design, memory hierarchies, and
pipelining.

### Credits

3-0-3

## Learning Ojectives

1. Critically evaluate the performance of computer systems (supports Student Outcome (3))

2. Discuss modern trends and challenges in computer system design

3. Understand how assembly language instructions are represented and executed by a processor

4. Write short, procedural assembly language programs

5. Understand the function call stack, its proper operation, common vulnerabilities, exploits, and defenses

6. Specify and minimize digital logic (supports Student Outcome (2))

7. Describe how the datapath and control work together in a processor to execute a program

8. Describe the memory hierarchy and be able to evaluate strategies for improving its performance

9. Understand the ethical issues and responsibilities of fair use with regard to
   hardware and software and its local and global impact on organizations.


## Student Outcomes

* (Outcome 2) Implementation. An ability to design, implement, and evaluate a
  computer-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the
  context of the discipline
  
* (Outcome 3) An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences about technical
information.

## Textbook

* Computer Organization and Design, *The Hardware/Software Interface 5th
Edition*, David Patterson & John Hennessy (**required**)

## Extra Instruction


* You are strongly encouraged to meet for extra instruction (EI) when you are having trouble.

* The best way to schedule EI is by prior arrangement by email. This will ensure that I'm available and can give you my full attention.

* We are open to arranging EI via phone/IM/skype etc., but these need to scheduled a priori. 

* You should always feel free to email your questions to your instructor, who should respond in a timely manner

## Collaboration

The guidance in the Honor Concept of the Brigade of Midshipmen and the Computer
Science Department Honor Policy must be followed at all times. See
www.usna.edu/CS/resources/honor.php.  Specific instructions for this course: All
projects, quizzes, and exams are individual effort only. Unless otherwise
specified in class, you may discuss homework and labs as much as you like with
other students, provided that:

1. You must clearly identify those that you collaborated with when turning in the assignment.
2. You must fully understand all of the techniques and solutions in your homework.
3. The actual pencil-to-paper or fingers-to-keyboard effort must be your
   own. Sharing files or parts of files between students is not permitted.
4. Complete all homework before entering the classroom on the due date.

All collaboration and outside sources should always be cited. The same rules
apply for giving and receiving assistance. If you are unsure whether a certain
kind of assistance or collaboration is permitted, you should assume it is not,
work individually, and seek clarification from your instructor

## Classroom Conduct

The section leader will record attendance and bring the class to attention at
the beginning and end of each class. If the instructor is late more than 5
minutes, the section leader will keep the class in place and report to the
Computer Science department office. If the instructor is absent, the section
leader will direct the class. Drinks are permitted, but they must be in
reclosable containers. Food, alcohol, smoking, smokeless tobacco products, and
electronic cigarettes are all prohibited. Cell phones must be silent during
class.

## Late Policy

Penalties for late submission of graded work may vary among courses or from
semester to semester, but they will be the same for all sections of a given
course. For this course:

* Full credit (submitted promptly at start of class on the due date)
* 20% off (submitted at the start of the next class meeting)
* No credit (submitted after that. However, **all assignments must be submitted
  to earn a passing grade**)
  
Projects will not be accepted late. They are due on the date specified. Late
projects will be marked as a zero.

### Assignments  (HW, Labs, Projects)

Assignments are a vital part of student learning for this course. Consequently,
to possibly receive a passing grade at 6-weeks, 12-weeks, or End-of-term, all
homework, labs, and projects due to-date must be completed and turned in, even
if the deadline for receiving credit on those assignments has passed. Any
cheating (including the receiving or giving of unauthorized assistance) will
result in, at a minimum, a grade of zero on the offending assignment, quiz, or
exam. All offenses will be reported to the Honor system. Class participation is
encouraged and expected. The instructor reserves the right to adjust the
composite grade by as much as two points based on class participation.


### Quizzes

Frequent short quizzes will be given at the discretion of the
instructor. Quizzes may be announced or unannounced. You are responsible to keep
up with the material in class.


### Readings

You will be required to submit short summaries of the textbook readings before
each class where a reading is assigned. Submission will occur via the submit
system, and you should provide about 5 key points from the assigned readings.

### Exams

All exams are effectively cumulative, though the 12-week exam emphasizes
material covered since the previous exam. The final exam will be cumulative


## Absences

Students are responsible for obtaining any material missed due to an absence
(notes, handouts, etc.) from the instructor, class web site, section leader or
classmates. Additionally, students must ensure that their work is submitted by
the deadline regardless of other commitments, i.e. duty, sick call, movement
orders. Should bona fide emergencies arise, it is the responsibility of the
student to coordinate with the instructor before the relevant deadlines.
