## Sequential Logic and Clocks

So far, we've only consider logic circuits that are *combinational* as they only
compute based on the current input. However, you can imagine computation that is
*sequential*, where the logic takes into account current inputs and previous
inputs. 

A previous input element will be stored *state elements*, which is updated based
on a clock cycle. This requires *feedback circuits* which cannot occur in
combinational circuits.
